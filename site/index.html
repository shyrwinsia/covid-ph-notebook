      <h1>Philippine COVID-19 Cases</h1>
      <h2>Jan 30, 2020 - Present</h2>
      <p class="description">This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth map</a> that
        shows the relative COVID-19 cases between municipalities and cities of the Philippines. The cases are
        normalized with the population of each local government unit. This provides an objective
        comparison of cases across boundaries, taking into account relative population densities.<br><br>This map aims
        to make patterns visible and provide insights on the spread of the disease and the effects of the community and
        government efforts. This only
        provides a "big
        picture" and does not have any interpretation of the data. This is left to you, the viewer.
        <br><br>All the data is free and comes from the public domain. The accuracy of the data will be done on
        best-effort policy. I will not be held liable for any damages that result in the usage of this map. All data is
        entered manually and that means this map
        may
        not be always up
        to
        date.</p>
